This data flow diagram illustrates how data moves through the EUCL Token Management System:

1. Client/Browser sends HTTP requests to the Nginx Load Balancer
2. Nginx forwards the requests to one of the Spring Boot Application instances
3. The Spring Boot Application processes the request through various components:
   - Authentication using JWT
   - User Service for user management
   - Token Service for token operations
   - Meter Service for meter management
   - Notification Service for sending notifications
4. The application interacts with:
   - PostgreSQL Database for data storage and retrieval
   - Email Server (SMTP) for sending notifications
5. The response flows back through the application to Nginx and then to the client

Key data flows:
- User registration and authentication
- Token purchase and validation
- Meter registration and management
- Notifications for expiring tokens
